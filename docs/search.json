To do this I first scraped property records from NYC DOF website using Python (BeautifulSoup4, Selenium, pypdf). I then queried NYC HPD, NYS DHCR, and NYC DCP data using SQL (SoQL) from NYC Open Data. I lastly applied time heterogeneous difference-in-differences method in R (fixest, MatchIt, iplot). I based my gentrification typology on the event driven framework of bunsen et al. (2023). Maps and visualizations were created in QGIS and R (ggplot2).\n\n\n\nRe-Measuring Speculation, Evictions, and Building Conditions in NYC’s Rent-Regulated Housing\nView the analysis (Quarto Site Link)\n\nEvaluates whether New York City’s Speculation Watchlist (SWL) successfully identifies purchases of rent-regulated buildings that are followed by worse outcomes for tenants and whether the methodology can be improved using data the city already collects. Uses NYC HPD, NYS DHCR, and NYC DCP data queried via SQL (SoQL) from NYC Open Data to deploy a causal inference (DiD) approach to compare the official SWL definition to an alternative, neighborhood-relative (NTA-level) approach in R (fixest, iplot). Maps and visualizations were created in QGIS and R (ggplot2)."

My name is Brady Kennedy, and I am a social data scientist and researcher with a focus on urban political economy, especially around housing and climate.\n    \n    \n      View my data science & policy research portfolio\n      View my CV\n      View my LinkedIn profile\n      View my GitHub repos\n    \n  \n\nMy main quantitative tools are R, SQL, and QGIS, but I am trained in Python and have more recently worked in qualitative and mixed-method research settings.\nBefore graduating with my MA in Sociology from Columbia, I honed my data analysis skills in multiple non-profit research positions and built my business and financial analysis in the private sector.\nI am currently employed as a Researcher based within the Columbia University Department of Sociology. I am working on an interdisciplinary project aimed at identifying and quantifying the co-benefits of climate action in the housing sector.\nMy academic interests lie at the intersection of housing markets, climate action, and urban theory. My recent work has tended to be more applied in the city and state policy worlds focused on the rent-regulated housing market and building decarbonization."
